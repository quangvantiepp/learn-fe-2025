The folder structure request. can open/ close folder.
can see that file is labeled or not (labeled = green, unlabeled=red).
selected input in front of it. (we need redux to save selected file and folder).
if you check folder, then select all in the folder unselect folder, then unselect all in the folder. Can select/unselect file.
when you open the folder, fetch only 1 level of it (there is no API for it. so please use MSW for it).
the pagination applies you maintain current, 2 previous page, 2 next page for UX. the number of pages can be changed(like 1 previous, 3 previous).
you only render components on window (i used react-virtualized for this feature before. so please consider about this)
when you loading the component, you should show loading components, this can be implemented using <Suspense /> or isLoading on react-query.
I recommend you to use react loading skeleton for it.
