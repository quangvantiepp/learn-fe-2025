# Step-by-Step Guide to Push Code with Git Rebase

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
    ```

3. **Make Changes and Commit**
    ```sh
    # Make your changes to the code
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

4. **Fetch the Latest Changes from the Remote Repository**
    ```sh
    git fetch origin
    ```

5. **Rebase Your Branch onto the Latest Changes**
    ```sh
    git rebase origin/main
    ```

    - Resolve any conflicts if they arise:
      ```sh
      # Edit the conflicted files to resolve conflicts
      git add <resolved-file>
      git rebase --continue
      ```

6. **Push Your Changes to the Remote Repository**
    ```sh
    git push origin <new-branch-name>
    ```

    - If you encounter any issues with pushing, you may need to force push:
      ```sh
      git push --force-with-lease origin <new-branch-name>
      ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
    - Go to your repository on GitHub (or your Git hosting service).
    - Create a new pull request from your branch to the main branch.

By following these steps, you can successfully push your code using Git rebase.
